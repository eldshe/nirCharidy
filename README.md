Hello dear viewer!

This is a raw, as-is folder of my C# .NET project using Visual Studio.
Make sure you notice that there are some NuGat packages installed in the project before trying to run it.


**A bit about this project:**


Dashboard and display panel I developed for my last educational institution. Software created in order to monitor almost in real-time the status of the fundraising project and to display the status to the participating collectors in the room.

- Simple code writing in C#, wrriten for two weeks. Mainly made use of HTTP web communication, front-end WinForms coding and third party APIs work. 
- Reading the project's online web page and reordering the data for better display. 
- Retrieving data from the project's real-time Google Sheets database through Google Sheets' API.
- Sending push alerts to 30 Android tablets, used by the collectors, for every new donation collected, through third party's push alert real-time engine API, for stimulation and encouragement.


Made for signal use. Good feedback from the users!
